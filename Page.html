            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Aryabhata was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian
                mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali
                Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Aryabhatta was born in Kerala and lived from 476 AD to 550 AD, he completed his education from the
                ancient university of Nalanda and later he moved to Bihar and continued his studies in the great centre
                of learning located in close proximity to Kusumapura in Bihar and lived in Taregana District in Bihar in
                the late 5th and early 6th century.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Concept of Zero</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In Aryabhatiya, he introduced a “system of numerals” using Indian alphabets to designate numbers.
                    His number system ensured that one would represent numbers up to 1018 with an alphabetical notation.
                    It is considered that Aryabhata was familiar with the concept of zero and the place value system.
                </li>
                <li>However, the symbol zero is found nowhere in Aryabhata’s works. French mathematician Georges Ifrah
                    argued that the knowledge and existence of zero were indirectly mentioned in Aryabhata’s place-value
                    system as a placeholder for the powers of 10 with null coefficients. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <h2>Calculation of Pi</h2>
            <p>Aryabhata calculated the value of Pi up to two decimal places, or 3.14. Then, in the second part of the
                Aryabhatiyam, he explained that to add four to a hundred, multiply it by eight. Then, add 62,000 again.
                As the rule concludes, one can find the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000. This way
                gives you the value of Pi, 62832/20000=3.1416. Aryabhata’s value of Pi is a close approximation of the
                contemporary value and the most accurate one amongst the ancients.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Solar System</h2>
            <p>Aryabhata came to the conclusion that the earth rotates on its axis daily. Therefore, the movement of the
                star is achieved by the movement of the earth. In the first chapter of his text, Aryabhatiya, he
                explains the number of rotations of the earth in a yuga. He made these claims when people still believed
                that the sky was moving. To describe his phenomenon of a concept, he proposed a geometrical model where
                two epicycles indicated the moon and the sun. According to the geographical model, the two epicycles
                governed the planets, where the smaller one was slow and the larger one was fast. He also claimed that
                the moon and other planets shine due to the reflected sunlight</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Contributions to Algebra and Trigonometry</h2>
            <p>He provided simple solutions to complicated mathematical problems like summing the first n integers, the
                square of the integers, and their cubes. In addition, he also correctly calculated the areas of a circle
                and a triangle, which you can find in his writings in Ganitapadam. He also provides a table of sines in
                trigonometry. He calculated the approximate values at 90°/24 = 3° 45′ intervals. Aryabhata utilized the
                formula for sin(n + 1)x – sin nx in terms of sin nx and sin (n – 1)x. He also introduced versine into
                trigonometry. </p>
